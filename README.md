# Todo App

This project is an Angular solution to the [Todo App challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/todo-app-Su1_KokOW). I built it when I first started learning Angular, after finishing a few smaller vanilla JavaScript projects.

The application lets you create, complete, filter and remove todo items and persists them in the browser. It was a fun way to explore components, two-way data binding and the Angular CLI.

## Development server

1. Install dependencies with `npm install`.
2. Run `ng serve` for a development server and navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `npm test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Further help

To get more help on the Angular CLI use `ng help` or go check out the [Angular CLI Overview and Command Reference](https://angular.io/cli) page.
